                                    I hate bananas. Every since I was little, I would never be able to stand the taste or smell of bananas. I can now tolerate the smell of bananas and the taste in banana bread and chips but I haven't eaten a whole one for as long as I can remember.<br>
                                    I am also scared of insects, like spiders. I really hate mosquitos because they seem to be very attracted to me, but when I get bitten, my bites swell up a lot.
