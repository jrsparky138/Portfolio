                           Hi! My name is Jane Rand. I am a rising senior at San Francisco High School.<br>
                           I am multiracial: Italian, French, and Chinese. <br>
                           I play volleyball and softball. I also love to go surfing and snowboarding. <br>
                           Travelling is a big part of my life ever since I was little. I love to experience different cultures and foods. I have been to 4 continents and can't wait to visit all 7 continents someday.

                                    I hate bananas. Every since I was little, I would never be able to stand the taste or smell of bananas. I can now tolerate the smell of bananas and the taste in banana bread and chips but I haven't eaten a whole one for as long as I can remember.<br>
                                    I am also scared of insects, like spiders. I really hate mosquitos because they seem to be very attracted to me, but when I get bitten, my bites swell up a lot.
